# Rampage Clinometer Documentation

## Project Overview
The Rampage Clinometer is a custom-built device designed to measure pitch, yaw, and the distance from objects using Arduino technology. With the integration of an accelerometer, ultrasonic sensor, and RF radios, this project aims to provide accurate and efficient readings crucial for various applications, including car dynamics monitoring.

## Components Used
- **Arduino board**: The microcontroller responsible for processing data.
- **Accelerometer**: Sensor used to measure the pitch and yaw angles.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Device utilized to measure distance to objects ahead of the car.
- **RF Radios**: Enable wireless communication for data transfer.

## Functionality
1. **Pitch and Yaw Measurement**: The accelerometer detects the orientation of the device, allowing for real-time calculation of pitch and yaw angles.
2. **Distance Measurement**: The ultrasonic sensor sends out a sound wave and measures the time it takes for the echo to return, calculating the distance to nearby objects.
3. **Data Display**: Results are displayed on a connected screen or transmitted wirelessly for monitoring.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Assembly**: Follow the schematic for connecting the sensors to the Arduino.
2. **Programming**: Upload the provided code to the Arduino board.
3. **Calibration**: Ensure all sensors are calibrated for accurate measurements.
4. **Operation**: Power on the device to start measuring pitch, yaw, and distances.
